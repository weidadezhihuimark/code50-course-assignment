""" Problem:

FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glenâ€™s letters, is a program from the early 1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text, a form of ASCII art:

 _ _ _          _   _     _
| (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
| | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
| | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
|_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/
Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at figlet.org/examples.html.

FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.

In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:

Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
Prompts the user for a str of text.
Outputs that text in the desired font.
If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message."""


import sys
from pyfiglet import Figlet
import random

def main():
    # Create a Figlet object
    figlet = Figlet()

    # Check for command-line arguments
    if len(sys.argv) == 3:
        # Check if the first argument is '-f' or '--font'
        if sys.argv[1] in ['-f', '--font']:
            font = sys.argv[2]
            if font not in figlet.getFonts():
                print("Invalid usage")
                sys.exit(1)
            figlet.setFont(font=font)
        else:
            print("Invalid usage")
            sys.exit(1)
    elif len(sys.argv) == 1:
        # Choose a random font
        figlet.setFont(font=random.choice(figlet.getFonts()))
    else:
        print("Invalid usage")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Prompt the user for text
    text = input("Enter text: ")
    # Print the text in the selected font
    print(figlet.renderText(text))
